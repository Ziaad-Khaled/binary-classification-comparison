# Machine Learning Classification Project

## Overview

This project focuses on binary classification using machine learning models to analyze and compare the performance on three different datasets. The datasets used in this project are as follows:

1. [Heart Disease Health Indicators Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexteboul/heart-disease-health-indicators-dataset)
2. [Income Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mastmustu/income) (Note: converted into a binary classification problem to predict income above or below $45K)
3. Gene Expression Data (provided in a zipped file)

## Tasks

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Properly scale and perform feature engineering on each dataset.

2. **Model Training and Testing**:
   - Train and test three different classification models on each dataset separately, resulting in a total of 9 different models.
   - Models used:
     - Logistic Regression
     - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) with 20 different K values (selecting the best K using the elbow method with plotting)
     - Support Vector Machine (SVM) with linear and two non-linear kernels (selecting the best kernel)
   
3. **Performance Metrics**:
   - Compute accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for each of the 9 models.

## Model Performance Analysis

The performance analysis for the different datasets and models can be found inside the project repository. Please refer to the project notebooks and analysis files for detailed insights into model performance on each dataset.

1. **Heart Disease Dataset**:
   - For the Heart Disease dataset, detailed analysis and justifications regarding model performance can be found in the project notebooks.

2. **Income Dataset**:
   - Similarly, for the Income dataset, model comparisons and justifications are available in the project notebooks.

3. **Gene Expression Dataset**:
   - The Gene Expression dataset's model performance and analysis can also be found within the project's analysis files.

Feel free to explore the project repository to access the in-depth analysis, including performance metrics and reasoning behind model selections.
